            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                We see our management, staff, students, host employers and other stakeholders as part of the Mathosim Trimming and Upholstery family and encourage creativity and innovation. Achievements from both staff and students are recognized and rewarded and together we: <strong>EQUIP, EMPOWER AND EXCEL!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our range of programmes is based on the list of critical and scarce skills as identified by the South African Government, but at the same time we are constantly seeking to improve and expand on these programmes to ensure we stay current and even ahead of the ever-changing needs in the industry. We believe that the aforementioned will undoubtedly foster job creation, especially by means of apprenticeships, learnerships and skills programmes incorporated into work placement. Through skills development constant job creation takes place. As more bursaries are awarded, more learners are recruited, which in turn leads to more facilitators to be employed. Learners recruited in our programmes we placed them at Host Employers which in turn benefits the business community and offering students the unique opportunity to work and gain the necessary experience while in training.
